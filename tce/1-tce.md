To install TCE on your personal computer, follow the instructions here: 

https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition/blob/standalone-overhaul/cli/cmd/plugin/standalone-cluster/README.md

NOTE: If you are installing via WSL2 on Windows, you need to grab the Linux Binaries, but make sure to install using the Calico CNI as the default CNI (Antrea) is not yet supported on Windows.  `tanzu standalone create hello --cni=calico`

We recommend allocating 12GB of RAM and 8 CPUs for your cluster.

Once the standalone plugin has been installed for your Tanzu CLI, you can create the cluster:

`tanzu standalone create local-tce`

You are ready to go when you see this message: <br>
âœ… Cluster created

Once the cluster is available, we will install the Tanzu Community Edition package repository. This will give us easy access to perform a managed install of software dependencies onto the cluster:

`tanzu package repository add tce-repo --url projects.registry.vmware.com/tce/main:0.9.1 --namespace tanzu-package-repo-global`
