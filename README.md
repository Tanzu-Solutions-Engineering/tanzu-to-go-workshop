# Tanzu To Go Workshop

#### Workshop content for creating a standalone Kubernetes development environment built entirely on open source

Here's the recipe for a delicious, free, 100% open-source, all-natural development workstation:

* We'll start with a foundation of Tanzu Community Edition, which gives us a composable Kubernetes cluster

* Next, we'll sprinkle in a dash of [kpack](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/kpack/), which automates the process of turning your source code into a running container.

* Time to add bold flavor with [Knative](https://knative.dev), which makes it easy to run, access, version, and scale our application

* We'll blend in [Cartographer](https://cartographer.sh/), which ties it all together and keeps your software supply chain running!

* For dessert, we'll take the source code for your favorite application, and onboard it to our new development platform!
