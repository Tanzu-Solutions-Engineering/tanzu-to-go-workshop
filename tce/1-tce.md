### Create your Kubernetes Cluster

Tanzu Community Edition allows you to create a local Kubernetes cluster that runs inside Docker, and supports easy installation of third-party [packages](https://tanzucommunityedition.io/packages/) to customize your environment.

Let's create a cluster on your local system, and call it `tce`.

```
tanzu standalone create tce --cni=calico
```

You are ready to go when you see this message: <br>
âœ… Cluster created

You can verify that your cluster is accessible by running the following command to view namespaces in your cluster:
```
kubectl get ns
```
